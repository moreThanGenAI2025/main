![Bohui Zhang](../assets/images/Bohui.png)
- **Bohui Zhang**
  Bohui is a PhD student at the Department of Informatics, serving as the main engineer and developer of the EntitySchema Generator. His doctoral research will concentrate on explainable automatic knowledge engineering. The aim is to automate the knowledge engineering process using language model-driven methods and address transparency issues in the knowledge graph lifecycle by bridging the gap between research methods and practical knowledge engineering needs. This involves effectively integrating explainable AI methods into this space. Additionally, he is open to exploring other topics in semantic web and natural language processing.
